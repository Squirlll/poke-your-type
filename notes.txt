WHAT DID I LEARN
html2canvas
you can use queryselectors on elements
you can access globally established variables in functions using bracket notation on window, ie: window[variable]
I thought making the dropdown would be as easy as making a select element and modifying something minor to make a search/filter bar.
that wasnt the case. Looked up how to do it, found semanticUI, but i didn't want to install a whole package just to achieve this.
I noticed the way it worked though was they had predefined classes that appeared to be triggering javascript. So I asked XpertAI about what approach I could do to achieve the same.
