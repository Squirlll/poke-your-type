NEXT TO DO:

- make user card have pokemon images based on selection
- organize where pictures will render after user selects choice
- look into more efficient way of calling array files (bundle?);
- add icon in input box








COOL IDEAS TO ADD AT END:


pokemon cries when you choose that pokemon

pokeball cursor for hovering over pokemon names in dropdown

change background color of dropdown li hover to type color

no east shellos or gastrodon image





WHAT DID I LEARN
you can use queryselectors on elements
you can access globally established variables in functions using bracket notation on window, ie: window[variable]
I thought making the dropdown would be as easy as making a select element and modifying something minor to make a search/filter bar.
that wasnt the case. Looked up how to do it, found semanticUI, but i didn't want to install a whole package just to achieve this.
I noticed the way it worked though was they had predefined classes that appeared to be triggering javascript. So I asked XpertAI about what approach I could do to achieve the same.
