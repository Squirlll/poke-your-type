NEXT TO DO:
html2canvas deleting type-icons on safari. maybe cuz svg?
maybe give height to icon
download works on live server (http) try on https

-i tried to display none the actual full sized card, but html2canvas does take a direct picture of it also hidden


- think about making the card automatically download at click instead of appearing underneath
- style in case of responsiveness on mobile, per diarmuid
- add make-your-own and url to bottom of user-card div

- add icon in input box




COOL IDEAS TO ADD AT END:

add options for background of card

pokemon cries when you choose that pokemon

pokeball cursor for hovering over pokemon names in dropdown

change background color of dropdown li hover to type color






WHAT DID I LEARN
html2canvas
you can use queryselectors on elements
you can access globally established variables in functions using bracket notation on window, ie: window[variable]
I thought making the dropdown would be as easy as making a select element and modifying something minor to make a search/filter bar.
that wasnt the case. Looked up how to do it, found semanticUI, but i didn't want to install a whole package just to achieve this.
I noticed the way it worked though was they had predefined classes that appeared to be triggering javascript. So I asked XpertAI about what approach I could do to achieve the same.
