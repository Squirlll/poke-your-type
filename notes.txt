NEXT TO DO:
- think about making the card automatically download at click instead of appearing underneath
- style in case of responsiveness on mobile, per diarmuid
- add make-your-own and url to bottom of user-card div

- need images of ogerpon variants; look through and delete or add photos for other variants of other pokemon
- same for new pokemon (eg: hdrapple has no images in pokeapi)
    - Archaludon, Hydrapple, Gouging Fire, Raging Bolt, Iron Boulder, Iron Crown, Terapagos,
- look into more efficient way of calling array files (bundle?);
- add icon in input box








COOL IDEAS TO ADD AT END:


pokemon cries when you choose that pokemon

pokeball cursor for hovering over pokemon names in dropdown

change background color of dropdown li hover to type color

no east shellos or gastrodon image
delete extra form names that have no image





WHAT DID I LEARN
you can use queryselectors on elements
you can access globally established variables in functions using bracket notation on window, ie: window[variable]
I thought making the dropdown would be as easy as making a select element and modifying something minor to make a search/filter bar.
that wasnt the case. Looked up how to do it, found semanticUI, but i didn't want to install a whole package just to achieve this.
I noticed the way it worked though was they had predefined classes that appeared to be triggering javascript. So I asked XpertAI about what approach I could do to achieve the same.
